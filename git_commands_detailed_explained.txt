Detailed Explanation of Commands Executed:

1. git init
   - Initializes a new empty Git repository in the current directory (D:/Devops).
   - A hidden `.git` folder is created which stores all repository data.

2. git add v1
   - Attempts to add a file named `v1` to the staging area.
   - Since no file named `v1` exists, Git returned the error: "pathspec 'v1' did not match any files".

3. git add .
   - Adds all files in the current directory (in this case, `v1.txt`) to the staging area.

4. git branch -M main
   - Renames the current branch to `main`. 
   - `-M` forces the rename even if the branch already exists.

5. git commit -m "first commit vikas"
   - Commits the staged file(s) to the local repository.
   - The commit message is "first commit vikas".
   - In this case, `v1.txt` was committed.

6. git remote add origin https://github.com/VikasMcr107/T1.git
   - Adds a new remote repository with the name `origin`.
   - This points the local repository to the GitHub repository at the given URL.

7. git push -u origin main
   - Pushes the local `main` branch to the remote repository `origin`.
   - The `-u` option sets the upstream branch, so in the future you can just use `git push` or `git pull` without specifying the remote and branch.
   - The push uploaded the commit with `v1.txt` to GitHub.

Final Outcome:
- A new repository was initialized locally in D:/Devops.
- A file named `v1.txt` was staged, committed, and pushed to the remote GitHub repository `T1.git` under the `main` branch.
